An example of what an OkCupid profile looks like can be [seen here](https://veryhighbrow.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/3cfbd-screen2bshot2b2015-04-042bat2b4-42-372bpm.png?w=757&h=408)). \n",

Please explore the data and see if you can find anything interesting in it! Then, in the answer section write down anything interesting you find. \n",

    "**Note**: There is a fair amount freedom to the degree that you challenge yourself here, and we will be relatively relaxed on the grading of this question. If you find the questions in this homework were easy, feel free to read about additional features of Python and experiment with these features to challenge yourself and to come up with an more interesting answer. If you found the above homework challenging, then just come up with a simple analysis (e.g., a couple lines of code), and make sure you understand all the code we have covered in class so far. At the moment we are a bit limited in the types of analyses since we have just started learning the basics of Python, but soon we will learn more methods that will allow you to answer much more interesting questions. \n",

    "**Tip**: It could also be useful to join strings in the `self_summaries` list into a single string called `summaries_string`. You can do this using the following line of code `summaries_string = \" \".join(my_self_summaries)`. "
