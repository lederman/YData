    "1. To better understand the data, please refer to the codebooks in \"Data and the American Dream\" the more comprehensive codebook found at: https://usa.ipums.org/usa/volii/codebooks.shtml. Also, note that sometimes the information in these cookbooks does not exactly correspond to the data we have, so if it is unclear what levels of particular variables mean, you can just say this when you describe your results. \n",

    "2. It could be useful to extract additional lists of data from the `acs_data1` DataFrame. For example, you might want to create a list that has the number of rooms in each person's house. To do this, please look at the code that created the list of `incomes`, `ages`, `sex` above, and if you can't figure it out please ask questions on Ed. Later in the semseter we will discuss exactly how this code works, but for how you can \"hack\" your way to creating relevant lists of data without fully understanding this one piece of code. \n",
    "\n",
    "3. There is a fair amount freedom to the degree that you challenge yourself here, and we will be relatively relaxed on the grading of this question. If you find the questions in this homework were easy, feel free to read about additional features of Python (e.g., how to change the colors in plots, etc.) and experiment with these features to challenge yourself. At the moment we are a bit limited in the types of analyses since we have just started learning the basics of Python, but soon we will learn more methods that will allow you to answer much more interesting questions. \n",
