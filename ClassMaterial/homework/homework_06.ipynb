    "**Question 3.1 (8 points)**. In order to get the distance between two geographic locations (such as a La Quinta hotel and Denny's restaurant), we need a function that can compute spatial distances. While the Euclidean distance function we created above is good for calculating distances on a flat plane, the Earth is round and thus the Euclidean distance is not an appropriate measure to use (although some people would disagree and say the [earth is flat](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt8132700/)). \n",

Your function should do the following: \n",

    "1. Convert all the longitude and latitude coordinates into radians by multiplying the original coordinates by $\\pi/180$. In your function, you can do this multiplication and then save the results back into the original argument names of `long1`, `lat1`, `long2`, `lat2`. *Hint: `math.pi` could be useful here.*\n",

Calculate a value `a` using the formula:  $a ~ = ~ sin^2((lat_2 - lat_1)/2) + cos(lat_1) \\cdot cos(lat_2) \\cdot sin^2((long_2 - long_1)/2)$. *Note: that $sin^2$ is the value you get by taking the sine of an number and then squaring the results. The functions `np.sin()`, `np.cos()` and `np.arcsin()` will be useful for this problem (be sure to use these NumPy rather than functions from other modules).* \n",
